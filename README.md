Returns 2 excel documents testing all variable pairs against a range of statistical tests
Currently built only for a specific input -> will need to be adapated at some point for 

                                             a) different variable types e.g. Categorical,
                                                       i) This also invites testing more than 2 variables at once
                                                       ii) This also demands different tests and an algorithm for determining which tests to apply
                                                       
                                             b) Different file inputs (txt, different layout etc)
